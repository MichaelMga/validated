 build an algorithm to maximize KYC :

 
 -what are the algorithms used?

Should we use an existing algorithm/ buy it?


Machine learning brings up to : 57% savings in the KYC process

Machine learning is fundamental in the process.

The high volume of transactional and customer data readily available in the

financial services sector makes it ideal.

Observing customer's behavioural patterns for any signs of abnormality,

giving them the ability to identify an

There are 2 types of ML algorithms used in fraud detection :

supervised and unsupervised learning.



Here are basically the methods used by those systems :

-Decision trees : set of rules (is this normal?)

why do banks and ask for proof of id? (BSA).

Companies need to conform to the "money laundering regulatios" to stop criminals from using them to launder money.


what has this do with banks.

So, that's the point ==> preventing money laundering.



Signs of money laundering :

So, we browsed litterature, and looked for the "red flags" documented.




Why some banks ask for id for a cash depost :

After browsing all subjects, it is very clear : the purpose of this system is to prevent money laundering.


Prevent money laundering by requiring confirmation that any cash deposits are going into the accounts that belong specifically to the depositor.

Ok, so that can be a proof this person actually receives a salary.



I'll tell him : ok, first draft. I keep building it.
